## What is this?

This crate provides a simple way to render 2D text with [`wgpu`](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/) by:

- rasterizing glyphs (with [`fontdue`](https://github.com/mooman219/fontdue/))
- packing the glyphs into texture atlas (with [`etagere`](https://github.com/nical/etagere/))
- calculate layout for text (with [`fontdue`](https://github.com/mooman219/fontdue/))
- sampling from the texture atlas to render text (with [`wgpu`](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/))

To avoid extra render passes, rendering uses existing render passes(following the middleware pattern described in [`wgpu`'s Encapsulating Graphics Work wiki page](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/wiki/Encapsulating-Graphics-Work).
